# Neural Network and Convolutional Neural Network from Scratch

## Description
This project has the aim to build a library for a NN and a CNN from scratch to better understand the way neural networks work. The project provides typical functions of neural networks to implement machine learning and apply it to a task. All functions were written from scratch, only numpy and matplotlib were used for the development of the functions. As one can imagine, coding a library for NNs and CNNs from scratch is a pretty extensive task. So this project provides a general and simple framework to get started with coding NNs and CNNs from scratch. The goal is to successively extend the library by adding more tuneable hyperparameters to the NNs.
