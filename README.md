# Neural Network and Convolutional Neural Network from Scratch

## Description
This project has the aim to build a library for a NN and a CNN from scratch to better understand the way neural networks work. The project provides typical functions of neural networks to implement machine learning and apply it to a task. All functions were written from scratch, only numpy and matplotlib were used for the development of the functions. Until now this project provides a general and simple framework to get started with coding NNs and CNNs from scratch and the goal is to successively extend the library by adding more layers, functions and tuneable hyperparameters for the neural networks.

## How to install and run the project
The code is written in Python 3.10.13 and Anaconda was used to create a virtual environment. The following packages were installed in that virtual environment:
- Numpy
- Matplotlib
- Tensorflow
- Sklearn
After the installation of the virtual environment you can download the scripts and open them.
